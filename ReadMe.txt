This is a school project that we had to develop for the course "Systems and Networks Programming". The goal of the project was to develop the transport layer (on UDP) for a file exchange between a server and a client. We were given three clients, that had each a different behaviour. The goal was to get the highest throughput.

The executables of the clients 1 and 2 are given in src. The client 3 is a scenario where multiple clients 3 are simultaneously exchanging a file with the server.
We were teams of one or two. I made this project with another classmate.
We ranked 1/40 on the first and third scenario with respectively 8.5 Mo/s and 27-30 Mo/s, and 3/40 with 2.25 Mo/s on the second scenario.
